nuFATE is a code that rapidly calculates the attenuated neutrino flux as a function of energy, neutrino flavor and zenith angle, due to the earth's opacity, for neutrino energies above 1 TeV. The software as implemented employs a user-specified power-law isotropic neutrino flux, the STW105 reference earth model, and neutrino-nucleon cross sections computed with the CT10nlo PDF distribution. The attenuation rates can be used to calculate the upgoing nu and nubar fluxes for high-energy neutrino observatories such as IceCube or ANTARES.

Prerequisites
-------------

The following packages are required to use the library, and
can probably be obtained from your favorite package manager:

* numpy: http://www.numpy.org/
* scipy: http://www.scipy.org/

Recommended:
* ipython: http://ipython.org/
* jupyter: http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/
* matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/

Example
-------

The one thing to remember is that the solution provided by nuFATE is E^2 * phi

The example script is called example.py. To run it do

python example.py

There is also an iPython notebook (notebook.ipnb) which shows some examples, including plots. This requires the "recommended" packages, above.
